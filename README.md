# kacky_maptimes
Webtool for KR2 - Check which maps are currently played and when a map will be played again. Also can calculate, at how long it will be until a map gets queued.

# How to use
Start it. Use it. No configuration needed, as data is pulled automatically from KR Servers.
Actually.. Don't "Start it. Use it.", just "Use it" at [https://kacky.dingens.me](https://kacky.dingens.me).

# Warnings
1. Dockerfile not thoroughly tested. Had it running once, but I don't really use Docker. You'll need to map a port to 5000 in the container.
